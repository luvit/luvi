A project in-between [luv][] and [luvit][].

The goal of this is to make building [luvit][] and [derivatives][] much easier.

## Workflow

Luvi has a somewhat unique, but very easy workflow for creating self-contained binaries on systems that don't have a
compiler.

```sh
# Make a folder
git init myapp
# Write the app
vim myapp/main.lua
# Run the app
luvi myapp
# Build the binary with compiled Lua code when done
luvi myapp -o mybinary
# Build the binary with compiled, striped Lua code when done
luvi myapp -o mybinary -s
# Build the binary just copy Lua code when done
luvi myapp -o mybinary --copy
# Run the new self-contained binary
./mybinary
# Deploy / Publish / Profit!
```

## Main API

Your `main.lua` is run in a mostly stock [luajit][] environment with a few extra things added. This means you can use
the luajit [extensions][] including `DLUAJIT_ENABLE_LUA52COMPAT` features, which we turn on.

### Libuv is baked in

The "uv" module contains bindings to [libuv][] as defined in the [luv][] project. Simply `require("uv")` to access it.

Use this for file I/O, network I/O, timers, or various interfaces with the operating system. This lets you write fast
non-blocking network servers or frameworks. The APIs in [luv][] mirror what's in [libuv][] allowing you to add
whatever API sugar you want on top be it callbacks, coroutines, or whatever.

Just be sure to call `uv.run()` and the end of your script to start the event loop if you want to actually wait for any
events to happen.

```lua
local uv = require('uv')

local function setTimeout(timeout, callback)
    local timer = uv.new_timer()
    local function ontimeout()
        print("ontimeout", self)
        uv.timer_stop(timer)
        uv.close(timer)
        callback(self)
    end
    uv.timer_start(timer, timeout, 0, ontimeout)
    return timer
end

setTimeout(1000, function ()
    print("This happens later")
end)

print("This happens first")

-- This blocks till the timer is done
uv.run()
```

### Integration with C's main function

The raw `argc` and `argv` from C side is exposed as a **zero** indexed lua table of strings at `args`.

```lua
print("Your arguments were", args)
```

The "env" module provides read/write access to your local environment variables via `env.keys`, `env.get`, `env.put`,
`env.set`, and `env.unset`.

```lua
local env = require('env')

-- Convert the module to a mutable magic table.
local environment = setmetatable({}, {
    __pairs = function (table)
        local keys = env.keys()
        local index = 0
        return function (...)
            index = index + 1
            local name = keys[index]
            if name then
                return name, table[name]
            end
        end
    end,
    __index = function (table, name)
        return env.get(name)
    end,
    __newindex = function (table, name, value)
        if value then
            env.set(name, value, 1)
        else
            env.unset(name)
        end
    end
}))
```

If you return an integer from `main.lua` it will be your program's exit code.

### Bundle I/O

If you're running from a unzipped folder on disk or a zipped bundle appended to the binary, the I/O to read from this
is the same. This is exposed as the `bundle` property in the "luvi" module.

```lua
local bundle = require("luvi").bundle
local files = bundle.readdir("")
```

#### bundle.stat(path)

Load metadata about a file in the bundle. This includes `type` ("file" or
"directory"), `mtime` (in ms since epoch), and `size` (in bytes).

If the file doesn't exist, it returns `nil`.

#### bundle.readdir(path)

Read a directory. Returns a list of filenames in the directory.

If the directory doesn't exist, it return `nil`.

#### bundle.readfile(path)

Read the contents of a file. Returns a string if the file exists and `nil` if
it doesn't.

### Utils

There is also a "utils" module that has some useful debugging stuff like a colorized
pretty printer.

```lua
local uv = require('uv')
local dump = require('utils').dump
-- Create a global p() function that pretty prints any values
-- to stdout using libuv's APIs
_G.p = function (...)
    local n = select('#', ...)
    local arguments = { ... }

    for i = 1, n do
        arguments[i] = dump(arguments[i])
    end

    local toWrite = table.concat(arguments, "\t") .. "\n"
    uv.write(stdout, toWrite);
end
```

## Building from Source

We maintain several [binary releases of luvi](https://github.com/luvit/luvi/releases) to ease bootstrapping of lit and
luvit apps.

The following platforms are supported:

- Windows (x86_64 / i386)
- FreeBSD 10.1 (x86_64)
- Raspberry PI Raspbian (armv6)
- Raspberry PI 2 Raspbian (armv7)
- Debian 9 "Stretch" (x86_64)
- OSX 10.14 "Mojave" (x86_64)

If you want to not wait for pre-built binaries and dive right in, building is based on CMake and is pretty simple.

### Build Dependencies

- Git
- CMake
- A C Compiler (visual studio on Windows)
- Perl (required for OpenSSL)
- NASM (required for OpenSSL ASM optimizations on Windows)

First clone this repo recursively.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/luvit/luvi.git
```

Then run the makefile inside it. (Note this assumes you have cmake in your path.)
If you're on windows, there is a `make.bat` file that works mostly like the unix
`Makefile`.

Prior to building the `luvi` binary you must configure the version of `luvi`
that you want to build. Currently there are three versions:

- tiny: only the necessities; omits OpenSSL, LPeg, and lrexlib
- regular: the normal luvit experience; includes OpenSSL, lpeg and lrexlib
- regular-asm: includes OpenSSL's ASM optimizations

```sh
cd luvi
make regular
make
make test
```

When that's done you should have a shiny little binary in `build/luvi`.

```sh
$ ls -lh build/luvi
-rwxr-xr-x 1 tim tim 948K Nov 20 16:39 build/luvi
```

## Usage

Run it to see usage information:

```sh
$ luvi -h

Usage: luvi bundle+ [options] [-- extra args]

  bundle            Path to directory or zip file containing bundle source.
                    `bundle` can be specified multiple times to layer bundles
                    on top of each other.
  --version         Show luvi version and compiled in options.
  --output target   Build a luvi app by zipping the bundle and inserting luvi.
  --main path       Specify a custom main bundle path (normally main.lua)
  --copy            Do not compile, just copy Lua code and compress.
  --strip           Compile Lua code and strip debug info.
  --force           Force build then bundle, ignore Lua compile error.
  --help            Show this help file.
  --                All args after this go to the luvi app itself.

Examples:

  # Run an app from disk, but pass in arguments
  luvi path/to/app -- app args

  # Run from a app zip
  luvi path/to/app.zip

  # Run an app that layers on top of luvit
  luvi path/to/app path/to/luvit

  # Bundle an app with luvi to create standalone
  luvi path/to/app -o target
  ./target some args

  # Run unit tests for a luvi app using custom main
  luvi path/to/app -m tests/run.lua
```

You can run the sample repl app by doing:

```sh
build/luvi samples/repl.app
```

Ot the test suite with:

```sh
build/luvi samples/test.app
```

## CMake Flags

You can use the predefined makefile targets if you want or use cmake directly
for more control.

```text
WithOpenSSL (Default: OFF)      - Enable OpenSSL Support
WithOpenSSLASM (Default: OFF)   - Enable OpenSSL Assembly Optimizations
WithSharedOpenSSL (Default: ON) - Use System OpenSSL Library
                                  Otherwise use static library

OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR                - Override the OpenSSL Root Directory
OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR             - Override the OpenSSL Include Directory
OPENSSL_LIBRARIES               - Override the OpenSSL Library Path
```

Example (Static OpenSSL):

```sh
cmake \
    -DWithOpenSSL=ON \
    -DWithSharedOpenSSL=OFF \
    ..
```

Example (Shared OpenSSL):

```sh
cmake \
    -DWithSharedOpenSSL=ON \
    -DWithOpenSSL=ON \
    -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl \
    -DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include \
    -DOPENSSL_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib \
    ..
```

## Holy Build

Executables across Linux distributions are not largely portable for various
differences. We can leverage the
[holy-build-box](https://github.com/phusion/holy-build-box) to create a
portable executable for i686 and x86_64 environments.

Note: If you are attempting this on OSX, please install GNU tar from homebrew:

```sh
brew install gnu-tar
```

To get started:

1. Create a docker machine:

    ```sh
    docker-machine create --driver vmwarefusion --vmwarefusion-cpu-count 3 holy-build-box
    eval $(docker-machine env holy-build-box)
    ```

2. Start the build

    ```sh
    make linux-build
    ```

3. Results should be the current working directory.
